Stochastic bridge on a 2D Limit Cycle
==========================================


This is an example notebook demonstrating the creation of stochastic bridges for a two dimensional limit cycling system.

For the creation of a stochastic bridges only a terminal constraint is necessary to be imposed onto the system dynamics.
