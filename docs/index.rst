Welcome to DeterministicParticleFlowControl's documentation!
====================================

`Deterministic Particle Flow Control` 
is a deterministic particle-based stochastic optimal control framework implemented in Python. 

To see how to use it, please refer to the `README file 
<https://github.com/dimitra-maoutsa/DeterministicParticleFlowControl/blob/main/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.

This is an example of documentation of the software, using sphinx_.
